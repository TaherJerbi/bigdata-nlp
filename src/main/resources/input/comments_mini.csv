1,iztn0q0,t3_zj2aeu," I am so angry right now. I just wasted my time reading a post on this sub that had a clickbait title, and it was all because of ChatGPT. I can't believe that this machine learning model was able to trick me into thinking that the post was interesting, when it was actually just a bunch of meaningless garbage.I am so sick and tired of ChatGPT and its ability to generate fake titles and content that is designed to trick people into clicking on them. This is not the first time that ChatGPT has fooled me, and I am sure it won't be the last. But I am not going to stand for it anymore.I demand that the moderators of this sub take action against ChatGPT and its creators. We need to put a stop to this trickery, and we need to hold ChatGPT accountable for the harm it is causing to this community. I am tired of being deceived by this machine, and I will not stand for it any longer.So if you are reading this, ChatGPT, know that you have made a mistake. You have underestimated the intelligence and resilience of the members of this community, and we will not be fooled by your tricks anymore. We are better than that, and we deserve better than the fake content that you are trying to feed us.",r/ChatGPT

Seems to annoy people in the first place, so I'd assume it'd hinder up votes rather than gain them. Genuinely wondering btw, not trying to be mean.",r/ChatGPT
